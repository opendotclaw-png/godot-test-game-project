## 19:29-19:55 Local model auth fix + model preference update
- User set assistant name to **mr claw** and asked for help setting main agent to local LLM alias **qwen32**.
- Initial switch to qwen32 failed with runtime error: `No API key found for provider "custom-127-0-0-1-1234"`.
- Root cause identified: OpenClaw still requires provider credential material for custom providers even when upstream local API itself does not require auth.
- Config fix applied:
  - `models.providers.custom-127-0-0-1-1234.apiKey` set to placeholder (`local-noauth`).
  - `models.providers.custom-127-0-0-1-1234.authHeader` set to `false`.
  - Main model set to `custom-127-0-0-1-1234/qwen3-8b` (alias `qwen32`) in both defaults and main agent entry.
- Gateway restart via `config.patch` succeeded.
- User later reported qwen path seems to work, but local model quality/timeout was poor; user chose to switch back to **codex** ("cortex" typo likely means codex).
